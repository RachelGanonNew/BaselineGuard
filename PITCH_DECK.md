# BaselineGuard â€” Pitch Deck

1. Problem
- Companies can't prove supply-chain compliance or ESG claims without exposing sensitive supplier data.

2. Solution
- BaselineGuard: privacy-preserving compliance proofs using Baseline Protocol + ZKPs and on-chain verification.

3. Demo
- Supplier creates claim; server generates ZKP (circom + snarkjs) proving a property; verifier contract verifies proof on-chain; audit ledger stores tx.

4. Why it will win
- Real ZK proofs + on-chain verification demonstrate technical depth.
- High business impact (ESG, audits, procurement).
- Clear demo path and integration points (ERP connectors, Baseline messaging).

5. Next steps
- Replace demo placeholders with real circuit artifacts and add ERP connectors.
